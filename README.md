## 🧪 Scientific Publishing Experience

**Senior Product Manager** @ [Frontiers Media SA](http://frontiersin.org) _(February 2022 - March 2024)_ <br>
Securing peer reviewers is the oil in the engine of the scientific publishing. Frontiers had developed a reputation for 'spamming' researchers in pursuit of these reviewers. I conceived, prototyped, user tested, led a team of developers, and delivered a new way of business—without sending emails. This mobile-optimized platform converted 6x better (~18%) than email invitations, improving the overall user experience at Frontiers.
 - Co-created vision to modernize Frontiers's peer review platform, rallied support for this vision across the company, and served as lead product manager for development and implementation of its MVP.
 - Created a vision to transform Frontiers's peer review invitation system, delivering two innovative products that attracted tens of thousands of users and increased invitation conversion 6x.
 - Led two cross-functional teams of product managers; UX designers and researchers; frontend and backend engineers; architects; and other stakeholders.
 - Conducted market analysis, organized design sprints, led user research, built prototypes, and developed product strategy aligned with Frontiers's business goals and the needs of 1.5 million users.
 - Managed product roadmaps, backlogs, and sprint planning to ensure the timely delivery of features, fixes, and enhancements.

**Senior Manager, Publications** @ [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) _(June 2019 - January 2022)_ <br>
German research institutions are generally unhappy with the costs, and constraints, of scientific publishing. Leveraging the growing trend of preprints, I conceived a two-sided market for reviewing preprints, product managed the delivery of an MVP reviewing platform, and pursued grants and VC funding for the project.
- Analyzed scientific publishing market to find space for building modern publishing workflows for researchers in Germany and around the world.
- Created product vision for a two-sided marketplace for the exchange and validation of scientific work, focusing on peer review as the key interaction.
- Promoted this workflow across Helmholtz's 19 research centers, conducting user research and validating concept with users (~250).
- Recruited and product managed external contractors to code (React/NodeJS) a MVP 'preprint review' platform.
- Created web design for the platform and implemented the design using CSS.
- Contributed Javascript fixes and minor functionality.

**Senior Publisher / Publisher** @ [Elsevier GmbH](https://www.elsevier.com/) _(October 2014 - June 2019)_ <br>
Researchers in Africa had a problem: communicating their science across borders was difficult. And Elsevier had a problem: their reputation amongst scientists was, on the whole, negative. Following extensive research—and travel to 🇬🇭 Ghana, 🇰🇪 Kenya, 🇷🇼 Rwanda, 🇸🇳 Senegal, and 🇪🇹 Ethiopia—I created _Scientific African_ in partnership with the [Next Einstein Forum](https://nef.org/). Publishing across disciplines and at low cost, SciAf has created a critically valuable resource—thousands of scientific articles for, and by, researchers from Africa.
- Developed and published _Scientific African_, the first Open Access megajournal for researchers in Africa.
- Developed and negotiated a partnership for _Scientific African_ with Kigali, Rwanda's Next Einstein Forum.
- Launched _Scientific African_ with [Elsevier’s CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka__ldVfjOc) at the Next Einstein Forum Global Gathering in Kigali, Rwanda in March 2018. The launch was covered in [_CBC Radio_](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-full-episode-1.4612977/often-sidelined-by-western-journals-african-scientists-get-their-own-peer-reviewed-publication-1.4612980), _Die Zeit_, _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_, _The Guardian_, _Le Monde_, and _Science_.
- Managed a portfolio of Food Science and Oceanography journals, with total revenues of ~$16,000,000 USD.
- Negotiated editorial, title, and society contracts, with a total annual operating budget of ~$1,000,000 USD.
- Coordinated and managed conferences, including the Food Structure & Functionality Forum Symposium, EFFoST, EuroSense, the Food Chemistry Conference, the NIZO Dairy Conference, and Pangborn.
- Actively managed 35 Editors-in-Chief, helping them achieve growth and quality targets by providing technical, publishing, and strategic support.
- Represented Elsevier at international scientific conferences, including the [Planet Earth Institute](https://planetearthinstitute.org.uk/'s) UnConference (2015, London, UK); the [UN Economic Commission for Africa](https://www.uneca.org/'s) Senior Experts Dialogue (2015, Nairobi, Kenya); and the Next Einstein Forum’s Global Gathering (2016, Dakar, Senegal).
