### 🏗️ WORK EXPERIENCE

**Senior Product Manager** @ [Frontiers Media SA](http://frontiersin.org) - _(February 2022 - March 2024) - 🇦🇹 Vienna, Austria_

> Peer reviewers make scientific publishing go, but they're overwhelmed with invitations and current platforms don't support their work. I built a platform that enabled Frontiers to attract reviewers without sending emails and an MVP reviewing platform to engage users.

- 👩‍🔬 Conceived, prototyped, user tested, and delivered a platform ([Frontiers Discover](https://progressreport.frontiersin.org/innovation)) to transform Frontiers's peer review invitation system.
- Discover attracted tens of thousands of users, boosted invitation conversion 6x (to ~18%), shortened review time by ~7 days, and improved the overall user experience at Frontiers.
- Co-created a vision and strategy to modernize Frontiers's aging peer review platform, the heart of its business.
- Rallied support for the new reviewing platform across the company, following years of stagnation, and served as lead product manager for implementation of its MVP.
- Led 3 cross-functional teams (~30 colleagues) — product managers; UX designers and researchers; frontend and backend engineers; architects; and other business stakeholders.
- Carried out market analysis, organized design sprints, conducted user research, constructed interactive prototypes in Axure, and developed product strategy aligned with Frontiers's business goals and the needs of 1.5 million users.
- Managed product roadmaps, backlogs, and sprint planning to ensure the agile and timely delivery of features, fixes, and enhancements.
