## 🧪 Product & Scientific Publishing Experience

### **Senior Product Manager** @ [Frontiers Media SA](http://frontiersin.org)  
_Vienna, 🇦🇹 Austria (February 2022 - March 2024)_

Peer reviewers make scientific publishing go, but they're overwhelmed with reviewing invitations and current platforms do little to support their work. I delivered a new platform that enabled Frontiers to attract reviewers without sending emails and developed an MVP platform to make reviewing more efficient. 
- Conceived, prototyped, user tested, and delivered a platform ([Frontiers Discover](https://progressreport.frontiersin.org/innovation)) to transform Frontiers's peer review invitation system.
- Innovative and mobile-friendly, Discover attracted tens of thousands of users, increased invitation conversion 6x (to ~18%), shortened review time, and improved the overall user experience at Frontiers.
- Via a series of design sprints, co-created a vision and strategy to modernize Frontiers's aging peer review platform, the heart of its business.
- Rallied support for the new reviewing platform across the company and served as lead product manager for UX design; frontend and backend development; software architecture; and final implementation of its MVP.
- Led three cross-functional teams (~30 colleagues)—product managers; UX designers and researchers; frontend and backend engineers; architects and other business stakeholders—to deliver MVP and integrate with existing platform.
- Conducted market analysis, organized design sprints, led user research, built prototypes, and developed product strategy aligned with Frontiers's business goals and the needs of 1.5 million users.
- Managed product roadmaps, backlogs, and sprint planning to ensure the agile and timely delivery of features, fixes, and enhancements. 

### **Senior Manager, Publications** @ [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en)  
_Munich, 🇩🇪 Germany (June 2019 - January 2022)_

German research institutions are generally unhappy with the costs, and constraints, of scientific publishing. Leveraging the growing trend of preprints, I created an MVP for a two-sided market for reviewing preprints.
- Analyzed scientific publishing market to find space for modern publishing workflows for researchers in Germany and around the world.
- Created product vision for a two-sided marketplace for the exchange and validation of scientific work, focusing on peer review as the key interaction.
- Promoted this workflow across Helmholtz's [19 research centers](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/about-us/helmholtz-centers/), conducting user research and validating concept with users.
- Recruited and product managed external contractors to develop an MVP 'preprint review' platform, leveraging [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).
- Created web design for the platform, implemented the design using Tailwind CSS, and contributed Javascript fixes and minor functionality.

### **Senior Publisher / Publisher** @ [Elsevier GmbH](https://www.elsevier.com/)

Researchers in Africa had a problem: communicating their science was difficult.

- Managed a portfolio of Food Science and Oceanography journals, with total revenues of >$16,000,000 USD.
- Negotiated editorial, title, and society contracts, with a total annual operating budget of >$1,000,000 USD.
