## 🔨 Experience
**Senior Product Manager** @ [Frontiers Media SA](http://frontiersin.org) _(February 2022 - March 2024)_ <br>
A rapidly-growing scientific publisher, Frontiers had developed a reputation for 'spamming' its users. I conceived, prototyped, user tested, led a team of developers, and delivered a new way of securing peer reviewers—the oil in the engine of the business—without sending emails. This mobile-optimized platform converted 6x better (~18%) than typical invitations, rescuing Frontiers, and its users, from hundreds of thousands of unnecessary annoyances.
 - Co-created vision to modernize Frontiers's peer review platform, rallied support for this vision across the company, and served as lead product manager for development and implementation of its MVP.
 - Created a vision to transform Frontiers's peer review invitation system, delivering two innovative products that attracted tens of thousands of users and increased invitation conversion 6x.
 - Led two cross-functional teams of product managers; UX designers and researchers; frontend and backend engineers; architects; and other stakeholders.
 - Conducted market analysis, organized design sprints, led user research, built prototypes, and developed product strategy aligned with Frontiers's business goals and the needs of 1.5 million users.
 - Managed product roadmaps, backlogs, and sprint planning to ensure the timely delivery of features, fixes, and enhancements.

**Senior Manager, Publications** @ [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en) _(June 2019 - January 2022)_ <br>
German research institutions are generally unhappy with the costs, and constraints, of scientific publishing. Leveraging the growing trend of preprints, I conceived a two-sided market for reviewing preprints, product managed the delivery of an MVP reviewing platform, and pursued grants and VC funding for the project.
- Analyzed scientific publishing market to find space for building modern publishing workflows for researchers in Germany and around the world.
- Created product vision for a two-sided marketplace for the exchange and validation of scientific work, focusing on peer review as the key interaction.
- Promoted this workflow across Helmholtz's 19 research centers, conducting user research and validating concept with users (~250).
- Recruited and product managed external contractors to code (React/NodeJS) a MVP 'preprint review' platform.
- Created web design for the platform and implemented the design using CSS.
- Contributed Javascript fixes and minor functionality.

🧑🏽‍🔬🌍 **Senior Publisher / Publisher** @ [Elsevier GmbH](https://www.elsevier.com/) _(October 2014 - June 2019)_ <br>
Researchers in Africa had a problem: communicating their science across borders was difficult. And Elsevier had a problem: their reputation amongst scientists was, on the whole, negative. Following extensive research—and travel to Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Senegal, and Ethiopia—I created Scientific African in partnership with the Next Einstein Forum. Publishing across disciplines and at low cost, SciAf has created a critically valuable resource—thousands of scientific articles for, and by, researchers from Africa.
- Developed and published _Scientific African_, the first Open Access megajournal for researchers in Africa.
- Developed and negotiated a partnership for _Scientific African_ with Kigali's 🇷🇼 [Next Einstein Forum](https://nef.org/).
- Launched Scientific African with Elsevier’s CEO at the Next Einstein Forum Global Gathering in Kigali 🇷🇼 in March 2018. The launch was covered in [_CBC Radio_](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-tuesday-full-episode-1.4612977/often-sidelined-by-western-journals-african-scientists-get-their-own-peer-reviewed-publication-1.4612980) _Die Zeit_, _Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung_, _The Guardian_, _Le Monde_, and _Science_.
- Managed a portfolio of Food Science and Oceanography journals, with total revenues of ~$16,000,000 USD.
- Negotiated editorial, title, and society contracts, with a total annual operating budget of ~$1,000,000 USD.
- Coordinated and managed conferences, including the Food Structure & Functionality Forum Symposium, EFFoST, EuroSense, the Food Chemistry Conference, the NIZO Dairy Conference, and Pangborn.
- Actively managed 35 Editors-in-Chief, helping them achieve growth and quality targets by providing technical, publishing, and strategic support.
- Represented Elsevier at international scientific conferences, including the [Planet Earth Institute](https://planetearthinstitute.org.uk/)'s UnConference (2015, London 🇬🇧); the [UN Economic Commission for Africa](https://www.uneca.org/)'s Senior Experts Dialogue (2015, Nairobi 🇰🇪); and the Next Einstein Forum’s Global Gathering (2016, Dakar 🇸🇳).
