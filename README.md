## Work Experience

### **Senior Product Manager** @ [Frontiers Media SA](http://frontiersin.org)
_Vienna, 🇦🇹 Austria (February 2022 - March 2024)_

Peer reviewers make scientific publishing go, but they're overwhelmed with reviewing invitations and current platforms do little to support their work. I delivered a new platform that enabled Frontiers to attract reviewers without sending emails and developed an MVP platform to make reviewing more efficient. 
- Conceived, prototyped, user tested, and delivered a platform ([Frontiers Discover](https://progressreport.frontiersin.org/innovation)) to transform Frontiers's peer review invitation system.
- Innovative and mobile-friendly, Discover attracted tens of thousands of users, increased invitation conversion 6x (to ~18%), shortened review time, and improved the overall user experience at Frontiers.
- Via a series of design sprints, co-created a vision and strategy to modernize Frontiers's aging peer review platform, the heart of its business.
- Rallied support for the new reviewing platform across the company and served as lead product manager for implementation of its MVP.
- Led three cross-functional teams (~30 colleagues)—product managers; UX designers and researchers; frontend and backend engineers; architects, and other business stakeholders—to deliver review platform MVP and integrate with existing platform.
- Conducted market analysis, organized design sprints, led user research, built prototypes, and developed product strategy aligned with Frontiers's business goals and the needs of 1.5 million users.
- Managed product roadmaps, backlogs, and sprint planning to ensure the agile and timely delivery of features, fixes, and enhancements. 

### **Senior Manager, Publications** @ [Helmholtz Munich](https://www.helmholtz-munich.de/en)
_Munich, 🇩🇪 Germany (June 2019 - January 2022)_

German research institutions are generally unhappy with the costs, and constraints, of scientific publishing. Leveraging the growing trend of preprints, I created an MVP for a two-sided market for reviewing preprints.
- Analyzed scientific publishing market to find space for modern publishing workflows for researchers in Germany and around the world.
- Created product vision for a two-sided marketplace for the exchange and validation of scientific work, focusing on peer review as the key interaction.
- Promoted this workflow across Helmholtz's [19 research centers](https://www.helmholtz.de/en/about-us/helmholtz-centers/), conducting user research and validating concept with users.
- Recruited and product managed external contractors to develop an MVP 'preprint review' platform, leveraging [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/).
- Created web design for the platform, implemented the design using Tailwind CSS, and contributed Javascript fixes and minor functionality.

### **Senior Publisher / Publisher** @ [Elsevier GmbH](https://www.elsevier.com/)  
_Berlin, 🇩🇪 Germany (October 2014 - June 2019)_

Researchers in Africa had a problem: communicating their science was difficult. Following extensive discussions with researchers and stakeholders on the continent—including in 🇬🇭 Ghana, 🇰🇪 Kenya, 🇷🇼 Rwanda, 🇸🇳 Senegal, and 🇪🇹 Ethiopia—I created _Scientific African_ in partnership with the [Next Einstein Forum](https://nef.org/).
- Developed, bulit a partnership for and published _Scientific African_, a critically valuable source of scientific information for, and by, researchers from Africa.
- Launched _Scientific African_ with [Elsevier’s CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ka__ldVfjOc) at the Next Einstein Forum Global Gathering in Kigali, Rwanda in March 2018.

- Managed a portfolio of Food Science and Oceanography journals, with annual revenues of >$16,000,000 USD and an annual operating budget of >$1,000,000 USD.
- Actively managed scores of Editors-in-Chief from dozens of countries, helping them achieve growth and quality targets for their journals by providing technical, publishing, and strategic support.
- Represented Elsevier at international scientific conferences, including the [Planet Earth Institute](https://planetearthinstitute.org.uk/'s) UnConference (2015, London, UK); the [UN Economic Commission for Africa](https://www.uneca.org/'s) Senior Experts Dialogue (2015, Nairobi, Kenya); and the Next Einstein Forum’s Global Gathering (2016, Dakar, Senegal).
